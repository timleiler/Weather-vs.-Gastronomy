This is my very first project to get in touch with the world of Git, Python and APIs. 

I will share my progress here. The goal is, that I want to be a pro in data analysist.

Almost everything here is new for me, so if you see something "stupid", feel free to tell me. 

The Idea of this project is to connect a weather API withe the google gastronomy API. The goal is, to learn the use of theses technolgies
maybe get some interesting results (probadly no brainer results).

I will descripte the project more in detail in the Project Description docx.
